// ## Create setter for onReady
// Usually when the coffee is ready, we want to do something, like drink it.

// Now, when coffee is ready, the onReady function is triggered, but it is strictly specified in the code:



// Setup the method setOnReady to have possibility to create your own onReady method. Example:


// P.S. *The default method onReady should be the same as before.* 

// P.P.S. *Try to make it so that setOnReady can be called not only before 
// but also after starting the coffee maker, that is, so that the onReady function 
// can be changed at any time before it is triggered.*
