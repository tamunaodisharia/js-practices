// ## Hamsters with __proto__
// You are the leader of the team that develops the game, the hamster farm. One of the programmers was tasked to create a class `hamster`.

// Hamster objects must have an `food` array for storing food and a `found` method that adds food to it.

// Below is solution, BUT when you create two hamsters, if you eat one, for some reason the second one also becomes full.

// Why? How to fix it?

function Hamster() {
    this.food = [];
    this.found = function(something){
        this.food.push(something);
    }
}


// Create two hamsters and feed the first
var speedy = new Hamster();
var lazy = new Hamster();

speedy.found("apple");
speedy.found("nut");

console.log(speedy.food.length); // 2
console.log(lazy.food.length); // 0
